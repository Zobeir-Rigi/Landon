# Landon Hotel: React App with AWS Integration

Just completed an exciting project crafting a single-page React app (Landon Hotel) powered by the magic of AWS! :rocket: Started with mock data, then elevated the game by setting up DynamoDB tables â€“ AWS's flexible NoSQL database. Loaded data seamlessly using Lambda functions, turning our app not just sleek but also serverless!

Here's the journey in plain language:

1. Used Amplify for quick and seamless deployment.
2. Created an IAM user for secure AWS access.
3. DynamoDB tables became our data playground.
4. Sent JSON data directly from React to DynamoDB.
5. DynamoDB data loaded flawlessly with the help of Lambda functions.
6. Introduced an API Gateway, acting as a traffic controller for our REST API, connecting React to AWS through various endpoints.
7. Updated CORS headers.

A journey filled with AWS wonders, React brilliance, and a touch of serverless magic! :globe_with_meridians::sparkles:
